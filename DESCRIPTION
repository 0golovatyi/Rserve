Description: Rserve acts as a TCP/IP server which allows binary requests to
  be sent to R. Every connection has a separate workspace and working
  directory. Client-side implementations are available for popular languages
  such as C/C++ and Java, allowing any application to use facilities of R
  without the need of linking against R code. Rserve supports
  remote connection, user authentication and file transfer.
